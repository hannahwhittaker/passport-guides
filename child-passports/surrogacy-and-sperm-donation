##Children born through surrogacy

As well as your [other documents](/get-a-child-passport/documents-photos), you need to send:

- a letter giving details of your surrogacy arrangement
- evidence of your surrogacy treatment, such as a letter from the clinic where it took place 
- proof that your child has a claim to [British nationality](/types-of-british-nationality/overview)
- proof of your identity (for example, your passport or birth certificate)
- proof of your marriage or civil partnership (if this is relevant to your application)

If you’ve been granted a parental order, you also need to send:

- the parental order (if you have it)
- your child’s birth certificate, issued after the parental order was granted

If you haven’t been granted a parental order and your child was born in the UK you can send their full UK birth certificate instead.

If you haven't been granted a parental order and your child was born outside the UK, there are [special rules about applying for a passport](/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas).

##Sperm donation

If your child was conceived through sperm donation and born in the UK, you need to send their birth certificate when you apply. You don’t need to say they were conceived through sperm donation.

There are [different rules](/government/publications/how-to-get-a-passport-if-your-child-was-conceived-through-sperm-donation) if they were born in another country.
