Apply for a child passport if your child's under 16. It costs £46 and is valid for 5 years.

It should take 3 weeks to get the passport - [use the 1 week Fast Track service](/get-a-passport-urgently) if you need it urgently.

^ Use a different service to [apply for a passport from outside the UK](/overseas-passports).

## Filling in the paper form

### Applying for a first child passport

Fill in sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9. Your child needs to sign section 6 if they’re 12 or over. Your countersignatory needs to fill in section 10 and [certify your child’s photo](/countersigning-passport-applications/when-to-sign-what-to-do). 

### Renewing a child passport

Fill in sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. Your child needs to sign section 6 if they’re 12 or over. If your child is 11 or under or can’t be recognised from their old passport photo, you’ll need a countersignatory - they need to fill in section 10 and [certify your child’s new photo](/countersigning-passport-applications/when-to-sign-what-to-do).
