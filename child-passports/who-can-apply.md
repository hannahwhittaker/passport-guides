Your child must have [British nationality](/types-of-british-nationality) to be eligible for a British passport.

A child passport is valid for 5 years.

##Who can apply

You can usually apply for a passport for your child if: 

- they're 15 or under 
- you have '[parental responsibility](/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility)' for them

You need to get ‘written consent’ from other people with parental responsibility if:

- your child’s passport has been lost or stolen - get written consent from the person who signed the application form for their last passport
- your child has changed their name - get written consent from everyone with parental responsibility

'Written consent' is a signed and dated letter from the person saying they agree to your child getting a new passport.

##Who signs the form

You need to sign your child’s application form.

If your child is aged 12 to 15 they need to sign the form too.

###Countersignatures

You must get your form and one of your child’s photos [countersigned](/countersigning-passport-applications) if any of the following apply:

- they’re aged 11 or under
- they’ve never had a British passport before
- they can’t be recognised from the photo in their old passport
- their old passport has been lost, stolen or damaged

##Children who are 16, or almost 16

Your child must apply for a 10-year adult passport if they'll be 16 within the next 3 weeks or they're already over 16. They don't need parental consent.

Follow the process for [renewing an adult passport](/apply-renew-passport) if they’ve already had a British child passport.

If your child has never had a British passport or they’ve only been included on yours, they must [apply for an adult passport](/apply-renew-passport).

^Your child can use their child passport until it expires, even if they're over 18.^
